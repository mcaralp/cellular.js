# Cellule.js

Cellule.js is a library to simulate cellular automata. Unlike most of other javascript libraries libe cellauto.js or cellular-automata, you does not have to write boilerplate code before actually writing the rules of your automaton. This library is heavily inspired by P5.js to bring a simplier approach of the simulation of cellular automata.
